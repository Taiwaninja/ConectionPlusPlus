The aim of the institution is to support the arts in the city, which was an important center of trade and business. Works of art were bought and exhibitions organized in order to open an access to art and culture for the public.\n\nAmong the founders were Johann Gerhard Christian Thomas, a senator and later mayor of the city, historian Johann Friedrich B\u00f6hmer, and art historian Johann David Passavant. Soon after the establishment of the museum, many important and influential citizens and artists became members.\nToday, the museum is situated in the center of Frankfurt, in a gothic building from 1464 called the Steinernes Haus , near the city's town hall. There are around 1,700 members who support the activities and enable the museum to reach its aim today, more than 150 years after its establishment. Although the museum has no permanent collection, as art is not purchased any more, its exhibitions of contemporary art are internationally renowned. Furthermore, guided tours, symposia, film programs, and excursions are organized. So even in the neighbourhood of important museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art  and Schirn Gallery , the museum manages to assert itself as an important meeting point not only for Frankfurt's art scene. Especially young artists of the state-run art school  and the well-known design school HFG are closely connected with the museum and cooperation is common.\\"

It is the only skyscraper in Frankfurt with a public viewing observatory. It is the 4th tallest building in Frankfurt and the 4th tallest in Germany, tied with Tower 185.\nThe structure was built between 1996 and 1999, and serves as headquarters for Landesbank Hessen-Th\u00fcringen . Other tenants are the German Offices of Merrill Lynch and Standard & Poor's and a television studio of the Hessischer Rundfunk. The first tenants moved in on 5 November 1999, and the official inauguration was 28 January 2000. During weather reports by the television station, the weather reporter stands on the top of the building.\nThe foyer of the building has two art pieces accessible to the public: the video installation by Bill Viola \"The World of Appearances\" and the wall mosaic by Stephan Huber \"Frankfurter Treppe / XX. Jahrhundert\" .\nThe tower's design features what appears to be two connected towers. The smaller of the two is of a cuboid shape and a design common to 1970s architecture. The second and taller of the two towers is a circular tower with an entire blue glass exterior which features the transmission tower on top."
