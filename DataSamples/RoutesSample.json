A lighthouse, Jaffa Light, is located above the port.\nIn 1917 during the World War I British troops under General Allenby defeated the Ottomans and took Jaffa, which became part of the British-administered Palestine mandate . In 1947 and 1948 there was sharp fighting between Jaffa, which was largely inhabited by Arabs, and the adjoining Jewish city of Tel Aviv. On the 13th of May 1948 , the Arab forces in Jaffa were defeated after long fighting with the Zionist underground Haganah and Irgun Zva'i Leumi forces. On 24 April 1950 the Jewish city of Tel Aviv and the Arab city of Jaffa were unified, and the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality was established. Today, Arabs of various denominations constitute about 25,000 inhabitants out of a total of 35,000 people. Jaffa has an old fishing harbor, modern boat docks, and a tourism center. Jaffa is a major tourist attraction with an exciting combination of old, new and restored buildings.
