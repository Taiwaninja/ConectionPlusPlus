The aim of the institution is to support the arts in the city, which was an important center of trade and business. Works of art were bought and exhibitions organized in order to open an access to art and culture for the public.\n\nAmong the founders were Johann Gerhard Christian Thomas, a senator and later mayor of the city, historian Johann Friedrich B\u00f6hmer, and art historian Johann David Passavant. Soon after the establishment of the museum, many important and influential citizens and artists became members.\nToday, the museum is situated in the center of Frankfurt, in a gothic building from 1464 called the Steinernes Haus , near the city's town hall. There are around 1,700 members who support the activities and enable the museum to reach its aim today, more than 150 years after its establishment. Although the museum has no permanent collection, as art is not purchased any more, its exhibitions of contemporary art are internationally renowned. Furthermore, guided tours, symposia, film programs, and excursions are organized. So even in the neighbourhood of important museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art  and Schirn Gallery , the museum manages to assert itself as an important meeting point not only for Frankfurt's art scene. Especially young artists of the state-run art school  and the well-known design school HFG are closely connected with the museum and cooperation is common.\\",

The area suffered major destruction during World War II and reconstruction left no visible signs of the ghetto in today's townscape of Frankfurt.\nPost-war usage of the area included a car park, a petrol station and a wholesale flower market. The decision to build an administrative complex triggered a public discussion as to what should be done with the archaeological remains uncovered during the excavation in 1977. The foundations of 19 buildings were found and five of these can be seen at the \"Museum Judengasse\" which was incorporated into the new building.",
